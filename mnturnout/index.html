<p>Statewide, voter turnout at this year's election was <a href="http://www.startribune.com/voter-turnout-fell-in-mn-but-the-state-s-back-on-top/400746791/">down slightly</a> compared to 2012, with a rate of 74 percent, but there were wide variations from county to county. Some experts say that could have played a role in an unexpectedly tight result, with Democrat Hillary Clinton edging out Republican Donald Trump in Minnesota by one percentage point.</p>
<p>The largest increases in percentage of voting-age residents casting ballots were in central Minnesota, counties that supported Trump, according to a Star Tribune analysis. Turnout in the Twin Cities metro and the northeastern corner of the state -- areas that typically support the Democratic candidate -- were mostly flat or slightly down.&nbsp;</p>
